Vicky works on a poultry farm. Every day he packs egg cartons for the local market. The ideal weight of an egg is 50 -70 gms. The eggs weighing above 70 gms are considered non-ideal weighed eggs. The eggs below 50 gms are faulty eggs and there can be a maximum of only 4 faulty eggs in a carton. If the carton has more than four faulty eggs, print â€œThe box contains more than four faulty eggsâ€ and terminate the program. Develop a program for the same using C++ concepts.

Note: Avoid the usage of exit(0) in the program. 

Sample Input/Output 1:

Enter the number of Eggs

6

Enter the weight of the eggs(in grams)

10.1

20.1

30.2

40.4

49.5

The box contains more than four faulty eggs

 

Sample Input/Output 2:

Enter the number of Eggs

4

Enter the weight of the eggs(in grams)

56.1

79

23.1

67.7

Count of eggs with ideal weight=2

Count of eggs with non-ideal weight=1

Count of eggs with faulty weight=1


Loop through Eggs:
Iterates through each egg using a for loop.
Reads the weight of each egg from the user.
Checks conditions:
If the weight is greater than 70, increments nonIdeal.
If the weight is less than 50, increments faulty. If more than 4 faulty eggs are found, breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, increments ideal.
Checks if the count of faulty eggs is greater than 4.
If true, outputs a message about more than four faulty eggs.
If there are not more than four faulty eggs, outputs counts of eggs with ideal, non-ideal, and faulty weights.
